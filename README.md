# HarpEngine
Harp Engine is a (currently) 2D C# game development framework built on the [Raylib Graphics Library](https://www.raylib.com/). It is outfitted with boilerplate code most scalable Raylib projects need to make prototyping simple and scope-creep manageable.

# Features
- Scene management system (with entities, update loops, and layers)
- Window resolution management (scale or clip game content automatically)
- Particle engine (simple, manageable, and extendible)
- Extended randomization (C#'s `Random` class is simply not enough)
- Time control (easily pause scenes, distort time, and create simple timers)
- Easing tools (interpolation has never been simpler)
- Transforms (opt-in parent-child system)

# Coming Soon
- 3D (1.5x more dimensions!)
- Physics engine (boing, clank, smack)
- Collision helpers (entity hug testers)
- Sprite animation system (yes, this is very important, just hol up a sec)
- Noise generation (Simplex, Perlin, Cellular)
