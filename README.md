# Harp Engine
Harp Engine is a C# game development framework built on the [Raylib Graphics Library](https://www.raylib.com/). It is designed to contain all of the boilerplate code most scalable Raylib projects use, and more. It is also a learning platform for the developer, Harper. At some point Raylib's systems may be replaced by (similar) custom systems designed to best suit the development environment.

# Features
- Scene management system (built to encapsulate update and draw loops)
- Window resolution management (scale or clip game content automatically)
- Particle engine (simple and manageable)
- Extended randomization (C#'s `Random` class is simply not enough)
- Time control (easily pause scenes, create simple timers)

# Upcoming
- Better cameras (Raylib is lacking in this department)
- Easing tools (interpolation has never been simpler)
